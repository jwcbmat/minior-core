## Description

A RESTful API built with [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/) to integrate with the [bento.ky](https://bento.ky) API, applying a margin to the delivery fee.

## Prologue

This project is my submission for the [bento.ky backend developer challenge](https://bento.ky).

The project is designed to be modular, readable, and easy to maintain, leveraging NestJS is native features. I also aimed to establish a solid foundation for testing and ensure a good experience for anyone reviewing or evolving this code in the future.

#### Core Stack

- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Axios / @nestjs/axios](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/http-module)
  - [@nestjs/config](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration)
  - [@nestjs/swagger](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction)
- [Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/client/libraries)
- [Jest + Supertest](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing)

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

## Epilogue

This project was a great opportunity to apply modern backend development practices using NestJS in a realistic scenario. I focused on keeping the codebase clear, organized, and consistent, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

There's always room for improvement, but I believe this implementation provides a solid and maintainable foundation — ready to support new features or adapt to evolving business logic.
